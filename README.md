# Google-Home-page-clone
Taking up various websites to clone. The google home page has been added to my list of websites to try and clone. Taking up basic html and css in getting a look alike site was both fun and really tasking. Learning about responsiveness, trying out several font sizes and giving commands to make sure the site looks like the original. Still haven't gotten the full hang of it but there sure is progress. This is the clone now and I believe I got it on check at about 70%. Will keep practicing and showing my progress in the coding world.
